# Weather-forecast
This project is a "Weather Forecast App" using "Streamlit", "Plotly", and the "OpenWeatherMap API". It lets users input a location, choose forecast days (up to 5), and view either "temperature trends" via interactive charts or "sky conditions" with weather icons. It ensures user-friendly visuals, error handling, and scalability. 🌦️✨
